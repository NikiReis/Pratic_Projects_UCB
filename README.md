Pratic Projects 1 and 2 - Algorithms and Programmation


This repository is reserved to save the 2 exams of 'Algorithms and Programmation' that i've studied
in the first semester of graduation.

In this repository you also  you find the Pratic Project 2 ( 2nd exam ) but did in Python.
Since i've finished the second exam using C programming language at the college i wanted to redo that exam using python,
so, i finally bring that ' personal project ' to reality.

I'm going to redo the 'Project Pratic 2' in three different version in Python, from a 'simpler' to a 'more complex one'.
First One: Using modularization, arrays and basic functions.
Second One: Using modularization, arrays and nested functions.
Third One: Using modularization and Object Oriented Programming

Disclaimer:
  Both Pratic Projects 2 (in C and Python) are in Brazilian Portuguese, it is going to be avaible in english and also in italian as soon as possible.
